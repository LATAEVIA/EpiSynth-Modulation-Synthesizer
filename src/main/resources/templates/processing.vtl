<h1>What is Processing 3?</h1>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Processing</a> is an open source programming language and integrated development environment <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">(IDE)</a> built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming through the instant gratification of visual feedback. The language builds on the Java language, but uses a simplified syntax and graphics programming model. Processing includes a <i>sketchbook</i>, a minimal alternative to an integrated development environment (IDE) for organizing projects. Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the <a href="http://processing.github.io/processing-javadocs/core/processing/core/PApplet.html" target="_blank">PApplet Java class</a> which implements most of the Processing language's features. <i>When programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as inner classes when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling. <strong>This means that the use of static variables and methods in classes is prohibited unless you explicitly tell Processing that you want to code in pure Java mode.</strong></i> Processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex data types that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: int (integer), char (character), float (real number), and color (RGB, ARGB, hex).
